            <p>Mangata and gallo was founder Lorem Ipsum is simply 
                dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
                but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
                essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
                with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
                passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
                like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
